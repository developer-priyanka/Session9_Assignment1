1. What is the total amount of petrol in volume sold by every distributer?

A = load'/patrol_dataset' using PigStorage(',') as (id:chararray,name:chararray,buyrate:chararray,sellrate:chararray,volumnin:int,volumeout:int,year:int);
B = foreach A generate name,volumnout;
C = group B by name;
D = foreach C generate group,SUM(B.volumnout);
Dump D;

2. Which are the top 10 distributers ID's for selling petrol? Also display the amount of
petrol sold in volume.

A = load'/patrol_dataset' using PigStorage(',') as (id:chararray,name:chararray,buyrate:chararray,sellrate:chararray,volumnin:int,volumeout:int,year:int);
B = foreach A generate id,volumnout;
C = order B by volumnout desc;
D = limit C 10;
Dump D;


3. List 10 years where consumption of petrol is more with the distributer id who sold it.

A = load'/patrol_dataset' using PigStorage(',') as (id:chararray,name:chararray,buyrate:chararray,sellrate:chararray,volumnin:int,volumeout:int,year:int);
B = foreach A generate id,volumeout,year;
C = order B by volumout;
D = foreach C generate id,year;
E = limit D 10;
Dump E;


4. Find the distributer name who sold petrol in least amount.

A = load'/patrol_dataset' using PigStorage(',') as (id:chararray,name:chararray,buyrate:chararray,sellrate:chararray,volumein:int,volumeout:int,year:int);
B = foreach A generate name,volumeout;
C = group B by name;
D = foreach C generate group,SUM(B.volumeout) as total;
E = order D by total;
F = limit E 1;
Dump F;
